### [Discovery](../unicornCompanies/unicorn_companies_discovery.ipynb)
The data I will use for this task provides information on over 1,000 unicorn companies, including their industry, country, year founded, and select investors. I will use this information to gain insights into how and when companies reach this prestigious milestone and to make recommentations for next steps to the investing firm.

### [Structure](../unicornCompanies/unicorn_companies_structure.ipynb)
We work with the unicorn companies dataset, discovering characteristics of the data, structuring the data in ways that will help us draw meaningful insights, and using visualizations to analyze the data. Ultimately, we will draw conclusions about what significant trends or patterns we find in the dataset.
